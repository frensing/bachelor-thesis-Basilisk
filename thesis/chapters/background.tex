This chapter introduces the fundamental topics and background information that we use throughout this thesis.
The Basilisk platform, that is developed in this thesis, focuses on benchmarking \tsp{}.
Triplestores are used in the research field of Semantic Web, therefore we give a short introduction to the most important topics from that research field.
Since the platform is actively developed during this thesis, software development is the second big topic we introduce in this chapter.
\\

In section \ref{sec:sw_topics}, building blocks of the Semantic Web are introduced.
In section \ref{sec:software_dev}, required topics from the field of software development are covered.
