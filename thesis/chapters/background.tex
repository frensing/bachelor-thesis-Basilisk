This chapter introduces the fundamental topics and background information we use throughout this thesis.
The Basilisk platform which is developed in this thesis focuses on benchmarking \tsp{}.
Triplestores are used in the research field of Semantic Web, therefore we give a short introduction to the most essential topics from that research field.
Since the platform is actively developed during this thesis, software development is the second big topic we introduce in this chapter.
\\
