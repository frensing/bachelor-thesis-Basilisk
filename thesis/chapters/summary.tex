\chapter{Summary and Discussion}
\label{ch:summary}

In this chapter we summarize our development of the Basilisk platform and highlight the key findings of the evaluation phase.
Lastly we point out the future work that can be done to extend the functionality of the platform.

\section{Summary}
In this thesis we have continued the development of the Basilisk platform.
The main task of the platform is to continuously check for new \ts{} releases and automatically perform benchmarks if a new release is found.
This functionality was successfully implemented for \dockh{} repositories and tested and evaluated with the \tentris{} and Oxigraph \tsp{}.



\section{Future Work}
The development performed in this thesis has resulted in a running version of the Basilisk platform.
Currently the benchmark process for \dockh{} is working and benchmarks are successfully performed.

Because the thesis time schedule had to be altered during the writing process, some developments could not have been fully implemented.


- Downloading source code form \gh{} and building the Docker container.

- User management

- Frontend

- sturdier exception handling

- defining for which version a \ts{} can be used (\eg{} v1.0.0 - v.1.1.1)
