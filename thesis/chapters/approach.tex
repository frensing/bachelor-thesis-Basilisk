In this chapter we give an overview of the current software architecture on which the Basilisk platform is build.
\\

The purpose of the Basilisk platform is to provide an easy way to continuously perform benchmarks on \tsp{}.
\tsp{} are often developed in teams who collaborate in Git repositories.
Releases of those \tsp{} are then published on \gh{} or as a Docker image on \dockh{}.
The idea for the Basilisk platform is to offer the possibility to automatically perform benchmarks for a new \ts{} release.

Benchmarks are also relevant during the development process.
An benchmark performed automatically for \eg{} a new pull request is a good way to estimate if a newly developed feature will impact the performance of the \ts{} before the changes are merged.

On the Basilisk platform a user can register a \ts{} for a continuous benchmark by setting up a hook to the repository on \gh{} or \dockh{}.
The repository will then be observed by the Basilisk platform.
If there is a new release of the \ts{}, Basilisk will generate a new benchmark job.
This benchmark job will then be executed by fetching and building a new docker container containing the newest release of the \ts{}.
On this container the benchmark will be performed.
The measured results of the benchmark will be stored in a \ts{} and are then available through the web frontend for review.
\\

The basic architecture pattern of the Basilisk platform is the microservice architecture (see chapter \ref{sec:microservice_architecture} for a short description). 
This means that the platform is divided into multiple services on which the workload and the different tasks are divided.
The services could be run on different hardware systems and they interact with each other via a message queue system.
\\

\section{Programming Language and Frameworks}
\label{sec:prog_lang_and_framework}
All services of the Basilisk platform are implemented with Java and are using the Spring Boot framework.
The services use Java version 11 and Spring Boot version 2.6.3.

The package structure used for the implementation of the services is similar in all three services.
It is strongly influenced by the structure recommended for the Spring Boot framework.
The Spring and Spring Boot framework are shortly described in chapter \ref{sec:spring}.

\section{Basilisk Frontend}
\label{sec:basilisk_frontend}
The Basilisk platform can be extended with a web frontend.
The frontend is implemented using JavaScript and the JavaScript Framework Vue.js

The idea is that the frontend functions as a graphical interface for the REST APIs of the three services explained in  section \ref{sec:main_services}.
The user can setup new repositories, \tsp{} and datasets.
Further the user can request information about current benchmark jobs, abort jobs or remove pending jobs.
Lastly the frontend can request and visualize the benchmark results stored in the \acl{jsts}.
