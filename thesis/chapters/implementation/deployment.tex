\section{Deployment}
\label{sec:deployment}
After the implementation phase, the Basilisk platform is deployed on a virtual server.
The virtual server used is provided by the IRB (Informatik Rechnerbetrieb) of the computer science department at Paderborn University.
Figure \ref{fig:vm_specs} show the specification of the VM.
The VM was chosen to be powerful and to have a lot of memory and storage.
Database benchmarks are often memory intensive and require a lot of storage for the different datasets.
