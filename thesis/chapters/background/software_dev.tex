\section{Software Development}
The following topics can be grouped under the field of software development.
For the topic of benchmarks (section \ref{sec:benchmark}) we focus on database benchmarks and especially \ts{} benchmarks, since this is the main goal of the Basilisk platform.
The sections Microservice and Microservice Architecture (\ref{sec:microservice}, \ref{sec:microservice_architecture}) explain the basic idea and concept of the microservice architecture style.
In the sections RabbitMQ and Spring (\ref{sec:rabbitmq}, \ref{sec:spring}) we give a short introduction and description of the main technologies that are used for the development of the Basilisk platform.

\subsection{Benchmark}
\label{sec:benchmark}
Benchmarks for databases consist of a data set and a set of operations or queries which will be performed on the data set.
These operations are designed to simulate a particular type of workload to the system.
The goal of a benchmark is to measure different metrics for a better comparison between various systems.
Metrics used for databases and \tsp{} are \eg, number of executed queries and queries per second\cite{IguanaDocumentationMetrics}.

A distinction is made between micro and macro benchmarks.
Micro benchmarks focus on testing the performance of single components of a system.
Macro benchmarks test the performance of a system as a whole.
The benchmarks performed by the Basilisk platform, which will be set up in this thesis, will only perform macro benchmarks.

\subsection{Microservice}
\label{sec:microservice}
A microservice is an independently deployable piece of software that only implements functionalities that are closely related to the main task of the service \cite{dragoniMicroservicesYesterdayToday2017}.
The microservice interacts via messages through a defined protocol with other services.

\subsection{Microservice Architecture}
\label{sec:microservice_architecture}
A microservice architecture is a way of designing a software application as a set of microservices which interact with each other to provide the designed functionality \cite{dragoniMicroservicesYesterdayToday2017, MicroservicesHttpsMartinfowler}.
The functionality of the application gets split up into microservices which interact only through a defined protocol of messages.
This allows for a distributed system in which the individual service could be implemented in different programming languages and also could be located on different servers.
Microservices can be individually deployed and managed.


\subsection{RabbitMQ}
\label{sec:rabbitmq}
RabbitMQ is an open-source message broker that supports different messaging protocols like MQTT, STOMP and AMQP.
The system supports a variety of asynchronous messaging techniques \eg, delivery acknowledgment, flexible routing\cite{RabbitMQWebsiteHttps}.

In the context of the Basilisk platform we only need the most basic functionalities of message queues with a single producer and a single consumer.
Since RabbitMQ is a widely used message broker, the Spring framework (\ref{sec:spring}) already comes with the needed libraries to work with the RabbitMQ system.


\subsection{Spring and Spring Boot}
\label{sec:spring}
Spring is a widespread open-source Java framework which facilitates the development process for various kinds of java applications and systems.
