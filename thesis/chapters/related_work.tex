This chapter reviews the state of the art of \ts{} benchmarking.

Several benchmarks have been proposed and developed.
Many of these existing benchmarks each focus on different goals and scenarios to test the \tsp{}.
The LUBM Benchmark\cite{guoLUBMBenchmarkOWL2005} is a synthetic benchmark which focuses on the reasoning capabilities of the \tsp{} under test.
The test data is about the university domain and can be generated to arbitrary size.
The benchmark provides fourteen extensional queries that represent and test a variety of properties.

Another synthetic benchmark is SPÂ²Bench\cite{schmidtSP2BenchSPARQLPerformance2008}.
