\chapter{Implementation}
\label{ch:implementation}



This chapter describes the implementation of the concepts explained in chapter \ref{ch:approach}.
Parts of the system were already implemented by other developers before this thesis.

As stated in section \ref{sec:architecture_review} parts of the functionality are still missing and need to be implemented.
This chapter documents the design and implementation of the explained shortcomings.
\\

The following sections of the thesis differ slightly from the proposed time schedule and task list, which was originally planned in the thesis proposal.
In Section \ref{sec:time_schedule} we explain why we had to alter the original thesis schedule based on the findings of the architecture review in section \ref{sec:architecture_review}.


In section \ref{sec:revised_solution_design} we describe how the missing parts of the platform are designed and implemented.
Possible problems or new insights found during this process are explained and dealt with.



\section{Thesis Time Schedule}
\label{sec:time_schedule}
The time schedule of the thesis had to be altered to allow for more time designing and implementing the Basilisk platform.

Before starting this thesis it was hard to quantify how much implementation work was still needed.
After the in-depth architecture review (\ref{sec:architecture_review}) it became clear that the implementation workload was greater than anticipated in the thesis proposal.

Therefore an alteration of the time schedule and work plan for the thesis is needed.
Further we discuss the task priorities.
First priority is the development of the core functionality for the platform.
This means the main services are required to successfully register new versions of observed repositories, perform benchmark jobs and save the measured metrics to a \ts{}.


With a lower priority, functionalities like user management (\ref{sec:review_user_management}) will be dealt with.
The least priority has the Basilisk frontend (\ref{sec:basilisk_frontend}), since it is not necessarily needed to run the platform.
Secondly it introduces more programming languages and frameworks to the project.
Currently time schedule for the thesis can not provide enough time to fully acquire the understanding for this technology stack.
Therefore the frontend will not be further implemented and deployed in the context of this thesis.
