	abstract = {Triplestores are data management systems for storing and querying RDF data. Over recent
	years, various benchmarks have been proposed to assess the performance of triplestores
	across different performance measures. However, choosing the most suitable benchmark
	for evaluating triplestores in practical settings is not a trivial task. This is because
	triplestores experience varying workloads when deployed in real applications. We address
	the problem of determining an appropriate benchmark for a given real-life workload
	by providing a fine-grained comparative analysis of existing triplestore benchmarks.
	In particular, we analyze the data and queries provided with the existing triplestore
	benchmarks in addition to several real-world datasets. Furthermore, we measure the
	correlation between the query execution time and various SPARQL query features and
	rank those features based on their significance levels. Our experiments reveal several
	interesting insights about the design of such benchmarks. With this fine-grained evaluation,
	we aim to support the design and implementation of more diverse benchmarks. Application
	developers can use our result to analyze their data and queries and choose a data
	management system.},
