\chapter{Formulation of Target Setting}
\label{ch:target_setting}

The target of this thesis is to setup and deploy an instance of the Basilisk service platform.
Since Basilisk is not yet fully developed, the missing parts will be designed and implemented first, before the system can be deployed publicly.
After that 3 benchmarks will be performed and evaluated.

If unforeseen problems arise, these will be documented and evaluated, to learn for further attempts.
