Triplestores are the database backend of knowledge graphs. 
They are needed to easily store and query data of knowledge graphs used in the Semantic Web.
%% TODO
Since these Triplestores need to handle a lot of different data and access types, it is a good idea to perform benchmarks.
%%
Benchmarks in general are used to measure and compare the performance of computer programs and systems with a defined set of operations.
Often they are designed to mimic a particular type of workload to the system.
In the context of Triplestores, a benchmark usually consists of creating a big knowledge graph, perform multiple queries and operations on the data.

What general topic are we interested in, why does it matter, where is it used, what problem does it solve?
Explain some more background for the topic, help the reader, who may have never heard of the topic, understand what you are talking about.

Current state of the research:
- What is a trivial way to solve x?
- How is x usually solved in practice?
- what are typical ingredients / techniques to construct the systems we are interested in?
- How does ? solve the problem?
- What does the algo in ? do roughly?
