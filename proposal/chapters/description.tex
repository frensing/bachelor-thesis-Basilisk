Triplestores are the database backend of knowledge graphs. 
They are needed to easily store and query data of knowledge graphs used in the Semantic Web.
%% TODO
Since these Triplestores need to handle a lot of different data and access types, it is a good idea to perform benchmarks.
%%
Benchmarks in general are used to measure and compare the performance of computer programs and systems with a defined set of operations.
Often they are designed to mimic a particular type of workload to the system.
In the context of Triplestores, a benchmark usually consists of creating a big knowledge graph, perform multiple queries and operations on the data.
